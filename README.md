Horse Grade
=====
This app will compare winning time against track record and will grade performance. App was made using Sencha Architect and can be found on GitHub or http://smallprogramdesign.com. I am still learning GitHub so bear with me as I am still making mistakes.


You can test app out by typing http://smallprogramdesign.com/myapp. 

example 1.) 

First you need Track Records. You can find most track records on Web.

Track record time of 2:01.4 at PIMLICO for 1 1/4 miles was by Horse name Manzotti;



Values for App:

ORB's first entry Race 12 at PIMLICO at  1 1/4 mile


Win = 202.89

Loss = 0

Record = 201.4


OXBOW's first entry Race 12 at PIMLICO at  1 1/4 mile
