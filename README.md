Horse Grade
=====
This app will compare winning time against track record and will grade performance. App was made using Sencha Architect and can be found on GitHub or http://smallprogramdesign.com. I am still learning GitHub so bear with me as I am still making mistakes.


You can test app out by typing http://smallprogramdesign.com/myapp. 

example 1.) ORB race 12 PIMLICO very first entry which will be results from Kentuckey Derby.

First you need Track Records. You can find most track records on Web.
Track record time of 2:01.4 at PIMLICO for 1 1/4 miles was by Horse name Manzotti



So: 

Win = 202.89
Loss = 0
Record = 201.4

Your Grade is 99.27

now OXBOW race 12 PIMLICO very first entry

Win - 202.89
Loss = 9.5
Record = 201.4

Your Grade is 98.35


Note: entering Loss convert 1 1/2 to decimal 1.5


Formula is Record/(Win -(Loss * 1/5))*100
