<p>Horse Grade is an app which will compare winning times against track record and will grade performance. The closest to 100% or greater, the better the performance. You can test app by clicking the link. <a href="http://smallprogramdesign.com/myapp">Click Here</a></p>

<h3>Design</h3>

<p>This was made using Sencha Architect and was developed just for fun.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>The formula used is Record/(Win+ (Loss * 1/5))*100</p>

<pre><code>Record - Track record for distance race
Win - Winning Time of race
Loss - Length loss by (note: if horse won this is left blank)
</code></pre>

Track record time of 2:01.4 at PIMLICO for 1 1/4 miles was by Horse name Manzotti;



Values for App:

ORB's first entry Race 12 at PIMLICO at  1 1/4 mile


Win = 202.89

Loss = 0

Record = 201.4


OXBOW's first entry Race 12 at PIMLICO at  1 1/4 mile


Win = 202.89

Loss = 9.5

Record = 201.4




Note : This was taken straight from racing form from PIMLICO. ORB's first entry which was the results from Kentucky Derby was 2:02<sup>89</sup>. Notice the colon on time from race is left out and the superscript is entered as a decimal. I found track records from PIMLICO here : Http://www.pimlico.com/race-info/track-records
